# BirdGame1
Hi, my name is Pee Jay and BirdGame1 is the first game I have ever made. This game resembles the famous "Flappy Bird" with its mechanics and design. I developed this game to be more familiar with unity hub's services, packages and be more proficient at using CSharp. I do not plan to release this in public and its only purpose is to develop my skills further.

#Mechanics
Press the play game option from the main menu to get started with the game.
Use spacebar to get through the gap between two poles. 
Getting through the gaps gives the player a point. 
Keep playing until bird dies.
Bird dies when it goes way out of bounds or it hits the pole.
Press the quit button to exit the application.
